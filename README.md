# Pack: Python Packages Packer

Internal core packages quickly grow out of hand with multiple teams contributing to them and sharing them across services, infrastructure, and scripts.

When someone starts a new project and adds the core package as a dependency, the environment/image size instantly increases by hundreds of megabytes or gigabytes.



### Notice 

If only a single independent constant was imported, the whole package needs to be added as a dependency. Is that really necessary? The new project has no use for 99.9% of the internal package code.

Optimally, the solution would be to split the package into smaller packages. Realistically, this is very hard to achieve because of 1) cross-dependencies, 2) having to refactor MANY projects/scripts/pipelines as well as developer and onboarding tools/documents.



### A solution?

If we knew what parts of a package are needed in a project, then we could technically analyze the dependency graph and prune everything that isnâ€™t needed before installing! Poetry allows 'extras' specification, which we can leverage here.

Smaller environments means less installation time, faster CI/CD pipelines, happier developers, and less storage space needed for installed packages.

In the very first trial of v0.0 of this, build times were reduced from 4 minutes to 10 seconds. In my case, the core package was not even that large (~700MB), which was reduced to 10MB only by installing only some of the dependencies.


### Some terminology
`Core package`: the package that is to be pruned of unnecessary dependencies
`Main project`: the project that depends on the core package.

### How it works
- Scan all the files in the main project and list modules needed from core package
- Find the dependencies needed by those important modules
- Handle nested dependencies in core package
- Return a list of the minimum required dependencies to make the core package work in this project
- Update the core package's pyproject.toml file with all-optional packages, and an extra section for this project specifying the minimum required deps.


### TODO:
[X] Create a function to calculate the minimum dependencies required by a core package to work within a project based on what parts are used
[ ] Create a command line interface to this function and more
[ ] Create a function that updates a pyproject.toml file as specified above
[ ] Look into pip requirements.txt support
[ ] Possibly calculate example dev impact, environmental impact of time saved in builds, as well as example storage space saved


### Tests
Here is an example test with some slightly complicated dependencies. You can see how the set of dependencies needed by the project to work is returned, and `secondary_utils.py`'s dependencies are ignored since this file is not imported into main_project.
